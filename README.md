# brightsource-demo
demo web app for brightsource by Gal Efraty

* added some extra responsive support 
* note that the 2 given api links return an invalid json so i inserted the data object into the code, and created 2 async functions to fetch the data in order to demonstrate an api request.
* the site is hostd in netlify - with an auto build&deploy process triggered on each merge into main branch.
